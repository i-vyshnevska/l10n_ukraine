To make it works you need to apply permission from bank to allow accept payments
form liqpay. Usually bank check your website shop for products, description etc.
prepare it first.
You probably also will need to configure ssl certificates on your site.
Get appropriate keys from bank and setup them in liqpay settings.
Check if api url didn't changed from last version.
